Help your heroes complete their power up ritual (HENSHIN!) before sending them out to battle against your friend! Completing the bonus keys before powering up is optional, and will give your heroes bonus power. Press a wrong key and your hero will turn into POOP. The first person to destroy the other player's city wins!

This game was made in 48 hours as part of the 2016 Global Game Jam. 

**Jam site:** Pittsburgh IGDA @ ETC  
**Diversifier:** No retreat, no surrender! -- The protagonist is unable to go anywhere but forward, in every situation.  
**Awards:** Honorable mention. This was the favorite game of one of the judges, Adam Nelson (founder of Pittsburgh's City of Play)!
